-  How much time was invested  <br/>
8h
-  How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), app mechanics) <br/>
  SwiftUI, MVVM
- Decisions made because of restricted time <br/>
  simplified app routing, small test coverage, no device rotation, poor views separation, poor error handling, simplifyed location request
